So this command should work right ?

rclone copy gcrypt2: /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/Test Data --include /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/Container --include /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/Multimedia --include /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/QmailAgent --include /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/Web --checkers 3 --fast-list --log-file /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/rclone/copy.log -v --tpslimit 3 --transfers 3

function: rclone listremotes #this lists all the remotes in the config file 

rclone moveto src dst

rclone --include ".DS_Store" copy "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/"S parvus RNAseq Data" -P


rclone moveto "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/LM5/ "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/"S parvus RNAseq Data"/ -P

----

this is the ways to use rclone, locally, or on the cluster.  this was done in windows , but can be the same for mac


---- 

this is the basic form of copying files, directory
this is the basic form of moving files or directories to another folder

this is one filter
this is another filter

use -P to help seeing progression 
use -vv for information 
use --dry-run for running without impacting the data (learn more about it)
you should use this flag to see what will happen and than 



advantages in using the cmd option is that there is no limit in time session, however I would assume
i should be corrected if i am worng, that it is faster using a clister session with more cores
or gpus being used. 

rclone --include "ML*" copy "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/"S parvus RNAseq Data" -P --dry-run


general notes:
i believe that copy mechanism and than delete is faster than a moveto option. the decisoin is yours. 

# moveto is for directories

rclone --include "/LM*" moveto "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/ML*\ "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/"S parvus RNAseq Data" -P --dry-run


rclone --include LM1/** --include LM33/** moveto "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/"S parvus RNAseq Data" --dry-run

rclone moveto "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/LM* "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/"S parvus RNAseq Data" --dry-run

rclone ls "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/ML* 

rclone copy "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog "NECT-Bornean Frog":/borneanfrog/"S parvus RNAseq Data" --include "{BR4,LM1,LM3,LM4,Sp1,Sp17,Sp22,Sp3}/**" --dry-run #this was to see that the code works

#because it is a problem to transfer or move multiple directories, i ended up copying and than deleting which is faster I believe. 
#yes this might not be effecient in typing directories of interest, but one can use filterring techniques better, i just couldnt figure it out.
